# CLAUDE.md — working conventions for this repo

## What this is

Structured logging for Firebase apps — a client logger (`/client`), a Cloud Functions
logger (`/functions`), and the `fsl` CLI (`/tools`). Published as
`@dasasian/firebase-structured-logger` — an npm library, **not** an MCP server, so there is
no MCP registry step.

## Build / test

`npm run build` (tsc) · `npm run typecheck` (tsc --noEmit) · `npm test`.

`npm test` runs the `tests/*.ts` tsx suites. Keep them green.

The functions-side suites — `errorPayload`, `requestLogger`, `handler`, `symbolication` — run
under `FUNCTIONS_EMULATOR=true` (already set in the `test` script) so they exercise emulator
mode without live credentials, writing to a throwaway `dev.jsonl` instead of Cloud Logging.

Two support modules, not suites themselves:

- `tests/testHelpers.ts` — `assert`, `reportResults`, `readLastEntry(dir)`, `clearLog(dir)`,
  `makeRequest(payload)`. Every suite uses these; don't re-roll them per file.
- `tests/browserStubs.ts` — in-memory `sessionStorage`, a fake `window` with
  `dispatchWindowEvent`/`listenerCount`, a stub `navigator`, and `withFrozenTime`.
  **Import it before the module under test** — `rateLimiter` reads `window` and
  `client/logger` reads `navigator` at module load, so a later stub is too late.

`errorPayload` is the parity suite: the client and functions loggers must build an identical
`ErrorPayload`. They share `src/shared/error.ts` now, but they drifted once before.

## Releasing

A library → **npm only** (no registry, no `server.json`, no tag-triggered publish workflow).
Full process + gotchas: `../PUBLISHING.md`. The short version:

1. Update `CHANGELOG.md` ([Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com) format): rename
   `[Unreleased]` to `[X.Y.Z] — <date>`, open a fresh empty `[Unreleased]`, and update the
   two link refs at the bottom of the file.
2. Bump `version` in `package.json`.
3. Commit `chore: release X.Y.Z` and push.
4. `npm publish` — needs your OTP. Traps: a `404 on PUT` = lapsed token (`npm login`);
   `npm view` can 404 for ~2 min after a *successful* publish (confirm with
   `npm access list packages`, don't re-publish).
5. `git tag vX.Y.Z && git push origin vX.Y.Z`; `gh release create vX.Y.Z` with the CHANGELOG notes.
6. Update the `dasasian.com/firebase-structured-logger` page in `dasasian-web`. Only
   `npm publish` and the release need your credentials; an agent drives the rest.
